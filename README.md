# Four-Phase Interleaved Boost Converter for Ion Propulsion

This project presents the design, simulation, and optimization of a high-efficiency, four-phase interleaved boost converter. It was developed as the first stage of a space-grade power system intended for ion propulsion.

##  Key Specs
- Input: 28 V (regulated spacecraft bus)
- Output: 100 V
- Power: 300 W
- Topology: Four-phase interleaved boost
- Simulated Efficiency: 96.9%
- Output Ripple: <50 mV
